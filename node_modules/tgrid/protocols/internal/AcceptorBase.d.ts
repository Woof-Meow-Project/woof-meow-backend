/**
 * Basic Acceptor.
 *
 * The `AcceptorBase` is an abstract acceptor class, who can accept or reject connection from
 * a remote client in the server side. If the client's connection has been accepted, the
 * `AcceptorBase` can start interaction with the client through the
 * [RFC](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid#13-remote-function-call) (Remote Function Call).
 *
 * Also, when declaring this {@link AcceptorBase} type, you've to define two template arguments,
 * *Header* and *Provider*. The *Header* type repersents an initial data gotten from the remote
 * client after the connection. I hope you and client not to omit it and utilize it as an
 * activation tool to enhance security.
 *
 * The second template argument *Provider* represents the features provided for the remote client.
 * If you don't have any plan to provide any feature to the remote client, just declare it as
 * `null`.
 *
 * @template Header Type of the header containing initial data.
 * @template Provider Type of features provided for the remote system.
